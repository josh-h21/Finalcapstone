Unsupervised learning- US Arrests database
This report presents an analysis of the "UsArrests.csv" dataset. 
The dataset contains statistics on the number of arrests per 100,000 
residents for three different types of crimes (murder, assault, and 
rape) in each of the 50 US states in 1973. Additionally, it includes
the percentage of the population living in urban areas.

In this task, we explore the differences between US States using
unsupervised learning methods, Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
and various clustering techniques. The dataset has 50 observations
for each US State and 4 variables (three for the types of crimes
and one for the urban population percentage). The data has been
imported and organised into a structured format, as a dataframe.
